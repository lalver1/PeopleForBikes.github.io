with the\ntools and libraries to be able to fix bugs or implement features in another one.\nRemoving choice fatigue\nWe aim at preventing choice fatigue by working with tools and libraries that we\nalready battle tested.\nFor instance a contributor looking to implement some logging in a new project\nshould not spend a day or two researching and evaluating libraries, but should\ninstead refer to this guide to pick the one we recommend.\nLimiting dependency proliferation\nLimiting the amount of third-party software you rely on reduces the surface of\nattacks you may be vulnerable to.\nHere as an example, are just a couple of impactful events that happen within\nrecent years:\n\nMalicious code found in npm package event-stream\nOpen Source Developer Intentionally Corrupts NPM Libraries\nGitHub Confirms Another Major NPM Security Defect\n\nLanguages\nLike dependencies, we try to reduce the amount of general-purpose programming\nlanguages we use for PeopleForBikes projects, therefore we decided to only\nadopt Javascript, Rust and Python.\nThey are respectively used for the following use cases:\n\nWeb projects must be written in Javascript\nProjects dealing with data science or GIS must be written in Python.\nAll other projects must be written in Rust.\n\nGeneral Concepts\nThese are general concepts that we attempt to abide to in the PeopleForBikes\nprojects.\n\nRecommended libraries are not set in stone\n\nPossible to add libraries if they meet pre-defined criteria\n\nActive project\n\nResponse to issues, PR within a reasonable timeframe (1-2 weeks)\nAt least one commit within the past 6 months\n\n\nNo known vulnerabilities\nWell enough documented\n\ni.e. no tribal knowledge required to use them\n\n\nSolve a problem\n\n\nReplacing/Removing a library is possible too\n\nPropose a new valid alternative\nPropose a replacement and/or deprecation strategy\n\ne.g. not all projects need to migrate, only new and very active ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse linters with default configurations\n\nUnless there is an absolute need for a change\n\n\n\nPython\nProject management\n\npoetry: Python project management de facto standard\ninvoke: Pure python task runner\n\nPoetry settings\nEach project must create a local virtual environment at its root :\npoetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local\n\npyproject.toml\nDescribes special sections to add to the pyproject.toml configuration file.\ncoverage\nLeaves some files out the measurements.\n[tool.coverage.run]\nomit = [\"*/__init__.py\"]\n\nisort\nEnables the compatibility with black while shaping the import as a grid where\neach import has its own line.\n[tool.isort]\nprofile = \"black\"\nforce_grid_wrap = 2\n\npytest\nRemoves the warnings, configures the code coverage report and run the doctests\nwith xdoctest.\n[tool.pytest.ini_options]\nminversion = \"6.0\"\naddopts = \"-p no:warnings --cov-report term-missing --cov-report html --xdoctest\"\n\nInitialization\nTo quickly start a project, run the following commands:\nexport POETRY_PROJECT=my-project\npoetry new ${POETRY_PROJECT}\ncd ${POETRY_PROJECT}\npoetry add -D \\\n  black \\\n  bpython \\\n  flake8 \\\n  furo\\\n  invoke \\\n  isort \\\n  myst-parser \\\n  pydocstyle \\\n  pylint \\\n  pytest \\\n  pytest-cov \\\n  pytest-mock \\\n  pytest-rerunfailures \\\n  pytest-socket \\\n  pytest-xdist \\\n  Sphinx\\\n  sphinx-autobuild \\\n  sphinx-copybutton \\\n  xdoctest\n\nLibraries\nProduction\n\naiohttp:

linter\nshfmt: shell formatter\n\nSQL\n\nsqlfluff: SQL linter and formatter\n\nTooling\n\njust: General purpose task runner\n\nWeb\nWeb project must be built with React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS.\nInitialization\nTo quickly start a project, run the following commands:\nexport WEB_PROJECT=my-project\nnpx create-next-app ${WEB_PROJECT}\ncd ${WEB_PROJECT}\nnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n\nGo through the next sections to configure Tailwind CSS correctly.\ntailwind.config.js\nWe extend the existing Tailwind CSS theme with the PFB fonts and colors:\n// tailwind.config.js\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    \"./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n    \"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    fontFamily: {\n      sans: [\"Montserrat\", \"sans-serif\"],\n      dharma\": [\"Dharma Gothic E\"],\n    },\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        \"pfb-deep-navy\": \"#00263E\",\n        \"pfb-bright-cyan\": \"#009EDB\",\n        \"pfb-bright-red\": \"#D71920\",\n        \"pfb-coal\": \"#4D4D4F\",\n        \"pfb-gray\": \"#8B8A8D\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\n\nCustom fonts\nPFB uses some custom private fonts that require some setup in order to be used.\nFirst, copy the font files into the public/fonts folder of the web project.\nThe font are available in the\nBrokenspoke repository.\nThe folders should look like this:\npublic\n├── fonts\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-Bold.otf\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-Light.otf\n\nAdd the new font-faces to styles/globals.css:\n// styles/globals.css\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Dharma Gothic E\";\n  src: url(\"../public/fonts/Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-ExBold.otf\") format(\"opentype\");\n}\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Dharma Gothic E\";\n  src: url(\"../public/fonts/Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-ExLight.otf\") format(\"opentype\");\n}\n\nA new custom font family is now available using the Tailwind CSS class\nfont-dharma.\nComponent Collections\nHere are the components collection that have been selected by the

standards\nGeneral recommendations\n\nProjects must provide a way to build artifacts using standard tools (i.e. no\ncustom scripts made for a specific machine/environment)\n\na package or binary depending on the language\na docker image\n\n\nProjects must include a Changelog following the\nKeep a Changelog recommendation\nProject must adhere to Semantic Versioning\n\nOr Calendar Versioning if it makes more sense.\n\n\nProjects must use Issues and Pull Request templates\nProjects must use meaningful labels\nProjects must be documented\nProjects must automate all their maintenance tasks\n\nMust ensure reproducibility\nA Makefile, justfile or a package.json at the root of the project is a good\nexample of how to automate maintenance tasks.\nThe commands must be backed by scripts (instead of being written inline).\n\n\nStart designing API specification before implementation (i.e. design first\napproach)\n\nOpenAPI 3+ specification\nZalando provides very good\nRESTful API Guidelines\nworth following\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration\nThe CI rules:\n\nProjects must comply with CI task requirements.\nDevelopers must be able to run the tasks locally.\nThe CI acts as the source of truth.\n\nThe PeopleForBikes/.github repository contains starter workflows that should\nbe used when creating a project.\nRequired tasks\n\nFormatter\nLinters\n\nCode\nDocs\n\n\nStatic analyzers\nDocumentation\nUnit tests\nFeature tests\n\nTry to cover 100% of use cases\n\nThis is more important than the unit test coverage\nIt will end up increasing unit test coverage anyway\n\n\n\n\nIntegration tests\n\nCan use network, database, file system, storage, etc.\nAre NOT included in the code coverage\n\n\nCoverage\n\nReaching 100% coverage is not the end goal\nMust never regress\nThink about your teammates who worked on increasing this coverage\nUse online services like coveralls or\ncodecov\n\n\n\nAdministrative tasks\nCreate a new GitHub repository\n\nRemark: this operation can only be performed by administrators.\n\nWe recommend using using the GitHub CLI in general as\nwe find it very convenient, but even if it is not your cup of tea, it should at\nleast be used to create new repositories with the right parameters from the get\ngo.\nStart by assigning the repository name to the PFB_REPO variable:\nexport PFB_REPO=my-project\n\nCreate the repository:\n\nRemark: adjust the --description and --gitignore flags with the\nappropriate values.\n\ngh repo create \\\n  \"PeopleForBikes/${PFB_REPO}\" \\\n  --public \\\n  --clone \\\n  --license MIT \\\n  --description \"Describe my project in one line.\" \\\n  --gitignore Rust\ncd \"${PFB_REPO}\"\n\nAfter that, import the .github directory:\nDOT_GITHUB_TMP=\"$(mktemp -d)/.github\"\ngit clone --depth=1 git@github.com:PeopleForBikes/.github \"${DOT_GITHUB_TMP}\"\nrsync -vrlp --exclude '.git' \"${DOT_GITHUB_TMP}\" .\n\n\nRemark: check the .github/workflows folder and remove the workflows that\ndo not pertain to the project.\n\nThen apply the labels with labelr:\nlabelr --organization PeopleForBikes --sync .github/labels.yml\n\nAnd finally submit the changes:\ngit add .\ngit commit -am \"Initial import\" -m \"Imports project scaffolding.\"\ngit push\n\n","id":"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/project-standards/","title":"Project
